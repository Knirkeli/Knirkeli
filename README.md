# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Eirik Kirkeli. Im a student at Noroff Vocational College.
I study to become a frontend developer.

I have always been creative and full of ideas. With front end, i feel i finally can use my creative potential to create and build.

Being able to use the stories i have created with and for my children in my year one exame was fantastic! please take a look at my potfolio to see my work!

##The skills i have aquired this year are:

- Design and design prinsiples. How to visualize a project using figma.
- Html. The basis of the web is facinating to learn and implement.
- CSS. Styling with css transforms the page and lets you form it the way you want.
    - using css frameworks to quicly build responsive and functional websites.
- Java Script. JavaScript allows me to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to my web pages.
- And some PHP. Php enables me to create server-side functionality and interact with databases.

Im looking forward to digg deeper into the world of Frontend development the comming school year.
